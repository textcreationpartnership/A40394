            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And no other way have I really to expreſſe it, but by the dedication of this little Book to your Ladiſhips acceptance: which if you ſhall condeſcend to patronize, (as your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſpects unto me, makes me confident you will) I ſhall rather increaſe, than any way leſsen

               </gap>eſſions of like nature in the ſame Pſalme. And will you know the reaſon of this his tranſcendent eſteeme of them? you may then thus collect it. As in the whole viſible World, there is nothing of more excellency than Man, and in Man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more excellent than the Soule, and in the Soule, nothing more excellent than the Underſtanding, and in the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nothing more excellent than Wiſdome; ſo moſt certain it is, that no Wiſdome that the Underſtanding is capable of, is ſo excellent as the Wiſdome from above, or the Knowledge of Divine things, which commonly we call Chriſtian Divinity; for whether we have reſpect to the Cauſes, the Effects, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Objects, the Adjuncts, or the ends thereof, it farre exceeds all the Arts, Sci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nces, Knowledge or Wiſdome that the World affords. The reſult therefore of all is, that it behoves every man that aymes at eternall happineſſe, not onely moſt highly to eſt eme it, but alſo in ſome good meaſure to attaine unto it. And therefore gentle Reader, although many have written divers excellent and ample Volumes of the whole body of Divinity, yet (as a mite caſt into the treaſurie) I hope thou wilt accept of this my weake endeavour, for thy Soules good, as an inſtrument conducing unto that end. It is indeed, but as a little Infant in compariſon with the talleſt Man; yet thou maiſt diſcerne, it has its full ſhape, as well as hath the greateſt,
<pb facs="tcp:55681:4"/> and Scripture enough to prove it to be Legitimate, and therefore as I doe commend it to thy charitable cenſure (hoping thou wilt not deſpiſe it for the ſmalleſt of its growth) ſo I doe no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that thou maiſt fully improve it to thy owne advantage: and to this end, I could wiſh thou wouldſt make it thy <hi>vade mecum,</hi> or thy pocket companion; that ſo in the end, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to memory, it may (to thy comfort) become thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome friend; or as an hid treaſurie in thy heart, that may helpe to maintaine thee in thy journey to the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſo although it be but little, yet (if by a faithfull application thou make much of it) at laſt thou maiſt finde it, to grow great in thy Soule, to thy everlaſting comfort: and therefore doe not onely caſt an eye upon it, and ſo lay it by, but take the paines to reade it through. It is but an houres labour, or a little more, deliberately to view it over, which being done, if then thou lik'ſt it, <hi>Quo animo legis obſerva, &amp; quo obſervas ſerva</hi> (as one ſaith well) with what affection thou readeſt it, obſerve it, and with the ſame affection thou obſerveſt it, remember it, and remember to practice it: and withall turne often to the Scriptures that (for the confirmation of thoſe truths) do ſtand in relation to each part of it; which being often revolved in thy minde, will much advantage thee in the knowledge of God, and of his revealed will. So God ſhall be glorified, thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding enlightned, thy Faith ſtrengthned, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thy Soule for ever comforted.
